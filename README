HISTORY
=======

mxe-octave was forked from the MXE project(http://mxe.cc) in November
2012 when I was looking for a reliable way to cross-compile Octave
for Windows.  At the time, the MXE developers did not seem interested
in modifying MXE to build shared libraries (.  Since then, MXE has been modified

As stated here:

I never intended to permanently fork MXE, I was only looking for a way
to build Octave and all its dependencies, primarily for Windows
systems.

Later, I needed to build Octave for old RHEL and SuSE systems that did
not have sufficiently recent versions of the build tools or other
dependencies.  Adapting MXE to handle native builds seemed like a
reasonable solution at the time, but there always seem to be issues
with replacing many (but not all) system libraries that are needed to
support Octave.  At what point do you stop?  You probably don't want
to build your own OpenGL, X11, or C libraries, and mxe-octave does not
attempt to build these.

FUTURE
======

Now that MXE supports static and shared library builds for 32- and
64-bit Windows systems, it might be good to consider using MXE
directly and abandon the mxe-octave fork, at least for Windows
builds.  Instead of mxe-octave duplicating all that MXE does, we could
use MXE to build the cross tools and cross compile the libraries.
Everything else could be built using those tools.  We might still end
up with some duplication, but we would

For native builds, I'm not sure what the best option is.  Many things
could be simplified in mxe-octave if cross compiling and supporting
Windows were not required, but there would still be a lot of overlap
with MXE.  Another option is to use docker, but older kernel versions
may not support it properly.  For example, for RHEL 6, docker is
apparently only supported using the EPEL packages, and if people were
able to use EPEL, then they could probably get dependencies that are
new enough to build Octave.  I my experience, people using these old
systems are not willing to use packages from EPEL or similar projects.
