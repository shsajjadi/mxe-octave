About
=====

    Version:

    http://www.profv.de/mingw_cross_env/

    This Makefile compiles a MinGW cross compiler and cross compiles
    many free libraries such as GD and SDL. Thus, it provides a nice
    MinGW cross compiling environment. All necessary source packages
    are downloaded automatically.

    The Makefile is designed to run on any Unix system. It also runs
    partly on MSYS. It needs GNU make and GNU sed, so FreeBSD users
    need the ports textproc/gsed and devel/gmake.


Usage
=====

    make

        build all packages,
        non-parallel

    make foo bar

        build packages "foo", "bar" and their dependencies,
        non-parallel

    make foo bar -j 4 JOBS=2

        build packages "foo", "bar" and their dependencies,
        where up to 4 packages are build in parallel,
        each with up to 2 compiler processes running in parallel

    make strip

        strip all package builds and remove unnecessary files

    make clean

        remove all package builds,
        use with caution!

    make clean-pkg
