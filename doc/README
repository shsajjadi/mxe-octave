MinGW cross compiling environment
=================================

    http://www.profv.de/mingw_cross_env/

    This Makefile compiles a MinGW cross compiler and cross compiles
    many free libraries such as GD and SDL. Thus, it provides you
    a nice MinGW cross compiling environment. All necessary source
    packages are downloaded automatically.

    The Makefile is designed to run on any Unix system. It also runs
    partly on MSYS. It needs GNU make and GNU sed, so FreeBSD users
    need the ports textproc/gsed and devel/gmake.


Usage
=====

    make

        build all packages

    make foo

        build package 'foo' and all dependencies

    make clean

        remove all package builds

    make update

        update the version numbers of all packages,
        use with caution!

    make dist

        build a source distribution tarball
