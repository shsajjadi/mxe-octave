<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>
Thank you for installing GNU Octave!
</p>
<p>
Octave 6.1 is a major release with many new features and improvements. Among
other things, it brings updates for Matlab compatibility, better graphics, and
many general improvements since version 5.2.
</p>
<p>
A full list of changes can be found in the Release Notes from the News menu.
</p>

<h2>Changed default installation location</h2>
<p>By default, Octave now installs to the system wide default program installation
location (likely inside <code>C:\Program Files\GNU Octave</code>).</p>
<p>It is now also possible to install Octave without administrative privileges.
<br>In that case (or if an admin choses to install for the "local user" only),
the default installation location is inside
<code>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\GNU Octave</code>.</p>

<h2>BLAS Library Selection</h2>
<p>During the installation, a default BLAS library was selected. The installer
contains two BLAS implementations,
the <a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/">NetLib reference BLAS</a>
and <a href="http://www.openblas.net/">OpenBLAS</a>.</p>
<p>The used implementation can be changed after installation with the "BLAS
Switcher" in the Start menu.</p>

<h2>Included Octave Forge Packages</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_Microsoft_Windows#Packages">
number of Octave-Forge packages</a> has been included with Octave for Windows.
However, the packages must be loaded in order to use them.</p>
