<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
Thank you for installing GNU Octave!
</p>
<p>
Octave 3.8 is a major new release with many new features, including an
experimental graphical user interface.  But because the GUI is not
quite as polished as we would like, we have decided to wait until the
4.0.x release series before making the GUI the default interface.
</p>
<p>
See the release notes or the "Experimental GUI Info" button in the GUI
for more information about the release and how you can help us with
GUI development and speed up the 4.0 release.
</p>
<h2>BLAS Library selection</h2>
<p>
During the install, a BLAS library was selected. The installer contains 2 BLAS implementations,
the <a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/">NetLib reference BLAS</a> and 
<a href="http://www.openblas.net/">OpenBLAS</a>.
</p>
<p>
Either can be selected after the install by copying librefblas.dll or libopenblas.dll 
to libblas.dll in the bin folder of the Octave installation.
</p>
<h2>Included Octave Forge Packages</h2>
<p>
A number of Octave-forge packages have been included with this install Octave, 
however they need to be installed in order to use them.
</p>
<p>
To install:
<ul>
 <li>Start Octave and then open the build_packages.m file found in the src folder 
where Octave was installed.</li>
 <li>Run the build_packages.m script to build and install the packages.</li>
</ul>
Packages must then be loaded in order to use them with the <tt>pkg load PACKAGENAME</tt> command.
</p>
<p>
Other packages are available from <a href="http://octave.sourceforge.net/">Octave-Forge</a>
