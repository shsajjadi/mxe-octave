<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
Thank you for installing GNU Octave!
</p>
<p>
Octave 4.0 is a major release with many new features including a graphical user
interface and support for classdef object-oriented programming.
</p>
<p>
A full list of changes can be found in the Release Notes from the News menu.
</p>
<h2>BLAS Library Selection</h2>
<p>
During the installation a default BLAS library was selected. The installer
contains 2 BLAS implementations,
the <a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/">NetLib reference BLAS</a>
and <a href="http://www.openblas.net/">OpenBLAS</a>.
</p>
<p>
The choice of library may be changed after installation by copying
either librefblas.dll or libopenblas.dll to the file libblas.dll in the bin
folder of the Octave installation.
</p>
<h2>Included Octave Forge Packages</h2>
<p>
A number of Octave-Forge packages have been included with Octave, however they
must be installed in order to use them.
</p>
<p>
To install:
<ul>
 <li>Start Octave and then open the build_packages.m file found in the src
 folder where Octave was installed.</li>
 <li>Run the script build_packages.m to build and install the packages.</li>
</ul>
Installation is a one-time procedure.
After installation packages must still be loaded in order to use them with the
<tt>pkg load PACKAGENAME</tt> command.
</p>
<p>
Other packages are available from
<a href="http://octave.sourceforge.net/">Octave-Forge</a>.
</p>
<h2>Issues</h2>
Please report any problems with Octave on the
<a href="http://octave.org/bugs.html">Octave website</a>.
